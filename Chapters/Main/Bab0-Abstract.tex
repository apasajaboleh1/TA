	\indent In this Digitalization era, the level of community needs for information is increasing. This make exchanging the information very easy. This makes the sensitive information leakage to the unauthorized party. The leakage of information divided into 2 when viewed from the integrity of information they get. First they get all information or second they only get a partial of information. Partial information leakage, make unauthorized party to reconstruct the information they get from all piece information they have already obtain.

\indent The problem in this thesis book is the problem to get plaintext as much as possible from the ciphertext and upper bound of key length. The encryption method is using the Vigenere Cipher technique. Given the plaintext and ciphertext, but there is missing information in both of them. Given the upper bound of key length, that is not real key length.

\indent In this thesis implement modified the Kasiski Examination to solve the problem, but it still take a lot of time to solve it. There need to optimization used to speed up the existing solutions by pruning the existing solution.
