	\indent Given uppber bond length of key to decrypt ciphertext. Given plaintext and ciphertext with the condition both have no part intact. Determine plaintext that can be reconstructed as much as possible.
\\
\indent Kasisiki Examination is a technic to find the true of the length of key to decrypt ciphertext, but still needed further optimization to get the result quickly.
\\
\indent In this thesis will design the problem solving presented in the first paragraph using Kasisiki Examination with optimization.
